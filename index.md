The module begins by describing how the Science Explorer (SciX) fits as part of the open science ecosystem and establishing how it supports the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. You will be introduced to search features through examples highlighting the strengths of SciX for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary queries. You will also learn how to use SciX’s suite of second order operators to explore research trends and reviews, along with methods of finding similar papers and papers others studying the same topic have found useful. Lastly, you will learn how authors can claim papers within SciX with their ORCiD. If you do not have an ORCiD, you are encouraged to apply in advance. 

You will evaluate whether you have accomplished each learning objective through "check your understanding" questions and through successfully completing related tasks.

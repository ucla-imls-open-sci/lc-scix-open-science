The module begins by placing the Science Explorer (SciX) and similar search engines in the open science ecosystem and establishing how they support FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. You will be introduced to search features through examples highlighting the strengths of SciX for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary queries. After guided exploration, you will apply these techniques to a question you might expect. Exploring the results of a search will include the steps for an author to claim a paper with their ORCiD. If you do not have an ORCiD, you are encouraged to apply in advance. When the you are comfortable with the search parameters, you will create a personal account, which will enable you to manage a SciX library. You will see the the power of such bibliographic collections by reviewing select public libraries. After which, you will build a private library based on you own interests before converting it to a public library for sharing. Because librarians field complex questions, you will also learn how you can contribute your personalexperience through SciX tools for submitting corrections and suggesting additions. SciX staff includes librarians and curators who are responsive to community needs.  

You will evaluate whether you have accomplished each learning objective through “check your understanding” questions and through successfully completing related tasks.

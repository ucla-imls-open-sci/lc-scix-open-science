The module begins by placing the Science Explorer (SciX) and similar search engines in the open science ecosystem and establishing how they support FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. The lessons, then, introduce learners to search features through examples highlighting its strengths for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary queries. After guided exploration, learners will apply search techniques to a question that they might expect. Exploring the results of a search will include the steps for an author to claim a paper with their ORCiD; learners without an ORCiD may apply during the lesson. When the librarians are comfortable with search parameters, they will create a personal account, which is required to manage a SciX library. The lesson will show the power of such bibliographic collections by reviewing select public libraries. After which, participants will build a private library based on their own interests before converting it to a public library for sharing. Because librarians field complex questions, the lesson will urge participants to contribute their experience through SciX tools for submitting corrections and suggesting additions. SciX staff includes librarians and curators who are responsive to community needs.  

Learners will evaluate whether they have accomplished each learning objective through “check your understanding” questions and through successfully completing related tasks. 

This module developed using the Carpentries Workbench complements the commitment of SciX to developing open source software and resources. Other SciX materials are available through GitHub, Hugging Face, and our website.
